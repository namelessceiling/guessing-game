This is a simple guessing game with four levels.

Enter 1, 2, 3, or 4 to get into one of the levels.

The player guesses a number and is told whether the number is too high or too low.

This continues until the correct number is guessed.

Once the player wins, they may play it again within the same level or change the difficulty setting

Results of how many tries it took to win in each game are printed after the player chooses to quit which is done by typing anything other than "yes"
